**Subreddit Hyperlink Network**: the subreddit-to-subreddit hyperlink network is extracted from the posts that create hyperlinks from one subreddit to another. We say a hyperlink originates from a post in the source community and links to a post in the target community.

Note that each post has a **title** and a **body**. The hyperlink can be present in **either the title** of the post or **in the body**. Therefore, we provide one network file for each.

The first step will be to concatenate those two datasets and provide w full dataset containing all directed and signed connexions between subreddits

The data contains 40 months of Reddit comments and posts



**BALANCE THEORY** :

	Considers the possible ways in which triangles on three individuals can be signed.
	it posits that triangles with **three positive signs** (3 mutual friends), and those with **one positive sign** (2 friends with common enemy) are more plausible (more prelevent) than triangles with **two positive signs** (2 enemies with common friend) or **none** (mutual enemies)
